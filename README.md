# homebrew-pints
A pint or two of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formulas

To install these formulas, first add this repository as a tap using
```bash
brew tap ararslan/pints
```

The following formulas are ready for use:

* wsedit
* Howl (it installs but there are OS X specific issues that don't seem to affect functionality)

These are still in development and should not be assumed to work:

* OpenLibm
* FemtoLisp
