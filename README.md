# homebrew-pints
A pint or two of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formulas

To install these formulas, first add this repository as a tap using
```bash
brew tap ararslan/pints
```

The following formulas are ready for use:

* [Rmath-julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Rmath-julia), the standalone Rmath library patched
with the dSFMT RNG
* [wsedit](https://github.com/SirBoonami/wsedit), a lightweight, terminal-based editor
* [Howl](https://howl.io), a lightweight, GUI-based editor (see formula caveats!)

These are still in development and should not be assumed to work:

* OpenLibm, a portable C mathematics library
* FemtoLisp, a Scheme-like Lisp dialect
